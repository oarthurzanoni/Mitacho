### Mitacho

#### Software Engineer<br>

---

Passionate about technology and software development.

I started coding in early 2021. I've always been looking to improve my skills. I have learned to create scalable, testable, and independent applications, applying principles, methodologies, and design patterns such as TDD, DDD, SOLID, and Ports & Adapters Architecture. And these principles and methods made me understand how to build high-level applications.

Currently, I'm working with technologies like JavaScript and TypeScript, Prisma ORM, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, Jest, Vitest, React.js, Next.js, Vite, TailwindCSS, styled-components, GraphQL, TypeGraphQL, Node.js, and Git.
